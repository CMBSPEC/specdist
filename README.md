Python package for spectral distortions

Mainly based on codes developed by Jens Chluba and the Manchester spectral distortions group (Boris Bolliet, Luke Hart, Tom Kite, Elizabeth Lee, Francesco Pace, Andrea Ravenni, Aditya Rotti, Abir Sarkar).

User dependent path have to be set in specdist/config.py.


cosmotherm comments:
* redshift dependent functions requiring PDE solver in output_fz_functions(), inside Solve_PDE.cpp.
